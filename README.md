Reset file untuk GoPro Hero 3
===================================

Unfortunately, it's not as easy with the 3rd generation and 3+ models. However,
it doesn?t take longer than a minute or two. All you need is your GoPro with the
microSD card inserted and the cable to connect it to your computer.

  * Connect your GoPro to your computer. (Alternatively, you can also just
    insert your microSD card using an SD card adapter)
    
  * Download the correct file from the list below
        GoPro Hero 3 (all editions)
        GoPro Hero 3+ Black
        GoPro Hero 3+ Silver
    
  * Extract the zipped folder.
    
  * Copy the contents of the folder and paste its content to the root folder of
    your GoPro?s microSD card.
        Hero 3+: Paste the whole "UPDATE" folder to your GoPro's root folder.
        The files must be in a folder with the name "UPDATE", otherwise it won?t
        work.
        
        Hero 3: Paste only the files, not the folder, to the root directory of
        your GoPro.
        
  * Unplug your GoPro. It should automatically turn off.
    
  * Turn it back on. Your GoPro should display now that it?s updating. Once it?s
    done it will turn off again.
    
  * You can turn it back on now and connect to its WiFi network with your device
    using the default login:
        Network name (SSID): GoProHero
        Network password: goprohero

In case you want to directly have a different SSID and password, you can change
that by editing two lines in the ?settings.in? file:

    "ssid":"GoProHero",
    "password":"goprohero"

I hope you managed to connect to your GoPro successfully. Now get back to it and
shoot some great stuff!
